Homebrew Formulae
=================

A personal git repository of Homebrew formulas that I have either:

* Created myself and not gotten around to pushing upstream, or ... 
* Made modifications to an existing install script for whatever
reason

Usage
=====

* In order to use these formulae with Homebrew, you can either:

```
brew install [raw GitHub URL to formula script file]
```

	...or

```
brew install [local git repo clone path to formula script file]
```
